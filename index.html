   <h4>Oversight of DS1 and DS2 Orbital Battle Stations construction projects
  </h4>
  <p>
During my tenure as a Supreme Imperial Fleet Commander I was in charge of large capital construction projects<br> for the Deep Space Fleet. Performed acceptance testing of the DS1 SuperLaser in 0 BBY by annihilating<br> Alderaan - a terrestrial class planet in the Core Worlds region. Successfully tripled the deep space fire power of<br> the imperial fleet in accordance with the Tarkin Doctrine before losing both projects to run-away photon torpedoes.
